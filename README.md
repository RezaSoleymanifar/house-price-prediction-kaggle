## House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle Competition

This project runs a Machine Learning ensemble model to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa. You can find the dataset 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). If you have `kaggle` installed you can simply run:

```bash
kaggle competitions download -c house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
```

To clone the project use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RezaSoleymanifar/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques-Kaggle-Competition..git
```

This project is run entirely on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). To install required packages run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Start training.

```bash
python train.py 'train_csv_file_path'
```

Note this replaces the pretrained pipeline `pipeline_full.pkl`. Training and cross-validation is parallelized between all CPU cores. This can take several minutes depending on your system.

- Start evaluation. 

<!--([pretrained model](https://github.com/tensorlayer/srgan/releases/tag/1.2.0) for DIV2K)-->

```bash
python predict.py 'test_csv_file_path' 
```

This will generate a `predictions.csv` file in current directory and prints the resulting RMSLE.

### Model Description

We use a stacking ensemble of random forest, extremely randomized trees, gradient boosted trees and a multilayer perceptron to predict the sales prices of homes in the dataset. The figure bellow can further explain how the model works. Data is initially passed through preprocessing pipelines that handle imputation of missing values, encoding categorical features and finally standardization of all features.

Features are then projected onto a lower dimensional space using PCA and data is fed into above
mentioned models. Each model generates its predicted labels and finally a linear regressor is trained to map these predictions onto the final labels. This practice--training a model on top of an ensemble, to aggregate the results of base models--is known as stacking.
